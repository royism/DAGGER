# DAGGER
DAGGER-Proof of Concept

Additionally, please make the necessary changes in the code to ensure:

==> Compatibility across different datasets, including high-dimensional and real-world network traffic data.

==> Efficient execution in resource-constrained environments, such as embedded systems or edge devices.



# DAGGER Framework

This is a modular Python implementation of the DAGGER framework designed for adversarial cryptographic stress-testing, aligned with IEEE MILCOM 2025 guidelines.

Modules:
- `main.py`: Entrypoint
- `model.py`: Generator, Discriminator, and DGN definitions
- `train.py`: Minimal training loop placeholder
